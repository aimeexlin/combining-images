# combining-images
ENGGEN 131 MATLAB Project 2019

This project required writing code that creates two different kinds of images from an arbitrary sequence of images that feature someone (or something) moving through a static scene. These images could be from a series of photos or a selection of frames taken from a movie.

One kind of image is known as an “Action shot”, which is a single image that features the moving person or object shown in different locations (see ActionShot.m). The other kind of image is one where the action has been removed, eliminating the moving person (or object) from the image, leaving only the static scene visible (see RemoveAction.m). All other files are helper functions.
